title: Hello World!
---
Hey and welcome to my new website!

My name is Vadim and I am an engineer and community leader for Facebook DevC. For most of the time, I've been writing code and organizing tech events which I absolutely love, but I've realized that sharing thoughts and experience on various topics is something I am laking of, so I decided to create this website in order to compile and organize everything that relates to my carrier and will be one of the platforms which I will use to write posts. 

I am very happy with the initial result of this website and I see a lot of space for improvements, so planning for a long run with it. 

This site is created with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) since I am a great fan of [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) and the React ecosystem, altho I will write a post about the technical perspective in detail soon.

For now, I decided to share my posts on this site and both [Medium](https://medium.com/@smirnov_v) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/fuzzyreason), so let's keep in touch and stay tuned!
