  Hi, I'm Vadim ðŸ‘‹

  I am a software engineer and community leader (currently for Facebook DevC) from Minsk, Belarus. I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make products that make life easier and better for people, my focus is front-end development with React.js, Gatsby, and everything that relates to the React ecosystem. Truly believe in the power of community and teamwork.

  I am inspired by music, football, my dog, and a cup of well-brewed coffee.
